# Weather-App

Please see the video of how the weather app. The website is not hosted anywhere done using localhost and react. Hello welcome to group thirty fiveâ€™s weather App. When the app is first loaded, the default city has been set as London so the app will show the information for the temperature at this exact moment in time. Furthermore, the app shows average temperature and weather for the 3 forecasted days and current temperature for today. 
 The weather temperature will be displayed in degrees. Also the description of the weather and icon which is received from the weather API is displayed here. In the middle of the page you can see the image of the city. The images used in this app overall is received from the unsplash API. Towards the bottom of the page, you can find emergency shortcuts that will take you directly to the relevant page when you click on them. As a tourist, these emergency features can be helpful in case of any unforeseen circumstances, such as getting lost, experiencing a medical emergency, or encountering a safety hazard. By using these shortcuts, you can quickly access the necessary information or assistance to address the situation. It's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with these emergency features before embarking on your travels. So if I clicked the hospital button, it will show the hospitals in the selected city. At the bottom of the page, there is a navigation bar where the user can navigate to other pages. These include the food places, activities, landmarks and transport in the selected city.  We have included food places as a page because tourists are often interested in trying out local cuisine and discovering new dining experiences. Providing information about food places can help them plan their meals and explore different types of food in the selected city. We have also included an activities page, so when tourists travel to explore and have fun, they can check this page out as activities are an important part of that experience. This page provides information about various activities, such as sightseeing tours, cultural events, and outdoor adventures,which  can help them plan their itinerary and make the most of their time in the selected city. Landmarks are popular attractions that many tourists visit to learn about the history and culture of a new city. So we have created a landmarks page providing information about landmarks that can help them plan their visits, to learn about the significance of each landmark. Getting around in an unfamiliar city can be challenging for tourists, especially if they don't speak the local language or are not familiar with the local transportation system. So, the transport page provides information about transport options, such as public transit, taxis, and rental cars, that can help them plan their trips and navigate the city more easily. Overall, by providing these four options, we aim to make it easier for tourists to plan their trips and have a more enjoyable and fulfilling travel experience in the selected city. The home button is also included in the navigation bar so the user at anytime can go back to the main page and search up another city if they wish. 

As mentioned above the two APIs we have used are WeatherApi and Unsplash Api. The WeatherApi offers real time weather data to the app. We chose WeatherAPI over OpenWeatherMap API because WeatherAPI provided more accurate and relevant weather data for the specific needs of the project. Furthermore, WeatherAPI provides specific days weather average forecast rather than an hourly one which was in the given API. The WeatherAPI uses API keys for authentication, and we as an user of weatherAPI generated these keys from our account dashboard. Unsplash API is the second API we used which provides access to a large collection of high-quality images. All the images used in this app are from the Unsplash Api. Using APIs saved us time by allowing us to easily integrate pre-existing functionality such as fetching weather data or images from platforms like Unsplash, which not only saved us from having to manually add this information but also provided us with access to millions of resources that we might not have otherwise had, making it a more efficient and effective solution. We also used react-router, which is the process of determining which component or page to render based on the current URL or user interaction. Using routing improves better user experience as routing allows users to navigate through different pages of a web application seamlessly. In our application the different pages would be the food places, activities and landmarks etc.
